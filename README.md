# End-to-End Healthcare Platform Testing

## Project Overview
This project involves **end-to-end testing** of a comprehensive healthcare platform that supports the enrollment and management of patients through their therapeutic processes. The platform ensures patient data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, providing a seamless user experience. Different user roles such as Care Navigators, Intake Specialists, Leads, Managers, and Reimbursement Specialists assist patients in enrolling in programs to access the required medical support.

The system integrates multiple modules and vendors, ensuring smooth interoperability and data exchange across platforms. The testing process covers a variety of workflows, spanning Salesforce, AWS, and associated brand websites.

## Objectives
1. **Shepherding patients through therapeutic processes** while ensuring confidentiality and security of patient data.
2. **Data Integrity:** Only authorized actors can view or modify patient data.
3. **System Availability:** Maximize platform uptime to enhance user experience.
4. **Integration Testing:** Validate smooth end-to-end interactions across internal and external systems, ensuring reliability of data transmission and workflows.

## Key Responsibilities
In this project, I play a critical role in ensuring the End to End quality and functionality of the platform through structured software testing processes. 

### Requirements Gathering and Test Planning
- **Requirement Refinement:** Collaborate with stakeholders to refine requirements for multiple releases.
- **Test Scenario Design:** Analyze requirements to create **test scenarios** and **test cases** for all functional modules.
- **Approvals:** Obtain approvals for all test cases from involved **Product Owners** and stakeholders before test execution.

### Test Execution
- **Test Case Execution:** Execute the test cases across different releases to validate end-to-end workflows and ensure system reliability.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Perform integration testing of all modules, ensuring seamless data flow across:
   - Salesforce
   - AWS DynamoDB
   - AWS S3 Buckets
   - AWS CloudWatch

### Collaboration with Vendor Teams
- Work closely with vendor teams to confirm data exchange and adherence:
   - **Direct Mail Communication** (e.g., patient communication workflows)
   - **Patient Adherence and Consent** validation
   - **Copay Insurance Card Details**
   - **Data Analytics and Reports**
